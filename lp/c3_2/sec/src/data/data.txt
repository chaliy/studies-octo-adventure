IT INTRODUCED A RADICALLY NEW METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, WHICH WENT FAR TOWARD SOLVING ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY, KEY DISTRIBUTI ON, AND HAS BECOME KNOWN AS DIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE. THE ARTICLE ALSO STIMULATED THE ALMOST IMMEDIATE PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF ENCIPHERING ALGORITHMS, THE ASYMMETRIC KEY ALGORITHMS. PRIOR TO THAT TIME, ALL USEFUL MODERN ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS HAD BEEN SYMMETRIC KEY ALGORITHMS, IN WHICH THE SAME CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY IS USED WITH THE UNDERLYING ALGORITHM BY BOTH THE SENDER AND THE RECIPIENT, WHO MUST BOTH KEEP IT SECRET. ALL OF THE ELECTROMECHANICAL MACHINES USED IN WWII WERE OF THIS LOGICAL CLASS, AS WERE THE CAESAR AND ATBASH CIPHERS AND ESSENTIALLY ALL CIPHER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT HISTORY. THE 'KEY' FOR A CODE IS, OF COURSE, THE CODEBOOK, WHICH MUST LIKEWISE BE DISTRIBUTED AND KEPT SECRET, AND SO SHARES MOST OF THE SAME PROBLEMS IN PRACTICE. OF NECESSITY, THE KEY IN EVERY SUCH SYSTEM HAD TO BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE COMMUNICATING PARTIES IN SOME SECURE WAY PRIOR TO ANY USE OF THE SYSTEM THE TERM USUALLY USED IS 'VIA A SECURE CHANNEL' SUCH AS A TRUSTWORTHY COURIER WITH A BRIEFCASE HANDCUFFED TO A WRIST, OR FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT, OR A LOYAL CARRIER PIGEON. THIS REQUIREMENT IS NEVER TRIVIAL AND VERY RAPIDLY BECOMES UNMANAGEABLE AS THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS INCREASES, OR WHEN SECURE CHANNELS AREN'T AVAILABLE FOR KEY EXCHANGE, OR WHEN, AS IS SENSIBLE CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRACTICE, KEYS ARE FREQUENTLY CHANGED.THE AGING DES WAS OFFICIALLY REPLACED BY THE ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD AES IN - WHEN NIST ANNOUNCED FIPS. AFTER AN OPEN COMPETITION, NIST SELECTED RIJNDAEL, SUBMITTED BY TWO BELGIAN CRYPTOGRAPHERS, TO BE THE AES. DES, AND MORE SECURE VARIANTS OF IT SUCH AS TRIPLE DES, ARE STILL USED TODAY, HAVING BEEN INCORPORATED INTO MANY NATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STANDARDS. HOWEVER, ITS X-BIT KEY-SIZE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO GUARD AGAINST BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS ONE SUCH ATTACK, UNDERTAKEN BY THE CYBER CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUP ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN-, SUCCEEDED IN- HOURS. AS A RESULT, USE OF STRAIGHT DES ENCRYPTION IS NOW WITHOUT DOUBT INSECURE FOR USE IN NEW CRYPTOSYSTEM DESIGNS, AND MESSAGES PROTECTED BY OLDER CRYPTOSYSTEMS USING DES, AND INDEED ALL MESSAGES SENT SINCE USING DES, ARE ALSO AT RISK. REGARDLESS OF DES' INHERENT QUALITY, THE DES KEY SIZE WAS THOUGHT TO BE TOO SMALL BY SOME EVEN IN-, PERHAPS MOST PUBLICLY BY WHITFIELD DIFFIE. THERE WAS SUSPICION THAT GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS EVEN THEN HAD SUFFICIENT COMPUTING POWER TO BREAK DES MESSAGES; CLEARLY OTHERS HAVE ACHIEVED THIS CAPABILITY.THE SECOND DEVELOPMENT, IN-, WAS PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, FOR IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE WAY CRYPTOSYSTEMS MIGHT WORK. THIS WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE PAPER NEW DIRECTIONS IN CRYPTOGRAPHY BY WHITFIELD DIFFIE AND MARTIN HELLMAN. IT INTRODUCED A RADICALLY NEW METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, WHICH WENT FAR TOWARD SOLVING ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY, KEY DISTRIBUTION, AND HAS BECOME KNOWN AS DIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE. HE MID-S SAW TWO MAJOR PUBLIC ADVANCES. FIRST WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE DRAFT DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD IN THE U.S. FEDERAL REGISTER ON MARCH. THE PROPOSED DES CIPHER WAS SUBMITTED BY A RESEARCH GROUP AT IBM, AT THE INVITATION OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS NOW NIST, IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP SECURE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION FACILITIES FOR BUSINESSES SUCH AS BANKS AND OTHER LARGE FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. AFTER 'ADVICE' AND MODIFICATION BY NSA, ACTING BEHIND THE SCENES, IT WAS ADOPTED AND PUBLISHED AS A FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARD PUBLICATION IN-. DES WAS THE FIRST PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CIPHER TO BE 'BLESSED' BY A NATIONAL AGENCY SUCH AS NSA. THE RELEASE OF ITS SPECIFICATION BY NBS STIMULATED AN EXPLOSION OF PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC INTEREST IN CRYPTOGRAPHY. THE AGING DES WAS OFFICIALLY REPLACED BY THE ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD AES IN- WHEN NIST ANNOUNCED FIPS-. AFTER AN OPEN COMPETITION, NIST SELECTED RIJNDAEL, SUBMITTED BY TWO BELGIAN CRYPTOGRAPHERS, TO BE THE AES. DES, AND MORE SECURE VARIANTS OF IT, ARE STILL USED TODAY, HAVING BEEN INCORPORATED INTO MANY NATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STANDARDS. HOWEVER, ITS X-BIT KEY-SIZE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO GUARD AGAINST BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS ONE SUCH ATTACK, UNDERTAKEN BY THE CYBER CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUP ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN-, SUCCEEDED IN- HOURS.
